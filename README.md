# Portfolio-2

This is my portfolio, built with SvelteKit. 

## Design

The design of the portfolio is a desktop windows based operating system. The windows can be opened, closed, resized and moved around the screen. There is also a taskbar at the bottom of the screen, which allows the user to switch between windows and access settings. The settings allow for changing the window style and other preferences.

## Development

After cloning the repository, you can install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`. Then, you can run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. 

## Bye Bye
